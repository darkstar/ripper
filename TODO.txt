ToDo:

Small Changes:
- Optionally write a .log file with all (hex-)offsets of the found files, and with debug info of the modules

Major changes:
- Remove/change "class File" to not map the whole file in memory at once.
  The input file is read in bytewise (block-buffered) and not memory-mapped as a whole.
  Only on a possible match is the file then mapped into memory, and the corresponding 
  ripper module is invoked. The mapping can start at where the pattern is at (optionally
  X bytes earlier which is specified in the header already and needed for MOD files for example).
  Need to check if it's not too slow mapping and unmapping the file thousands of times in a row.
  If it turns out to be too slow, the mappings could be reused on a watermark-based system:
  on the first HIT, map as much of the file as possible into memory, starting from 
  current_position - header_offset, and mapping MIN(filesize, 2gb). Then, on a later HIT, check
  to see if the file is not mapped till the end AND the current position is like 50% into the 
  mapping (for example at 1g into the mapping for a really huge file). If so, remap with the new
  current_position - header_offset as base.
  We also need to check on each HIT whether current_position-header_offset is smaller than the 
  currently mapped file portion (which can happen if header_offset is >0) and re-map in that case too
- Make the program 64-bit aware (by changing hardcoded assumptions about sizeof(short) and sizeof(int))
- Make the program big-endian aware (by wrapping all data accessors in wrapper functions)

New Ripper Modules (in order of importance):
- Microsoft DOC/XLS/... (this is a special chunked file format inofficially called LAOLA which is used by all office programs and some other programs too)
- PNG (should be easy)
- OGM (should be straightforward)
- FLI/FLC should be straightforward but not 100% foolproof (false positives?)
- more MODULE formats (669, XM, IT, S3M, ULT, DMF, MTM, NST, STM, ...)
- ZIP files? (detect from the beginning, like pkzipfix)
- TIFF, TGA detection
- Maybe EXE detection? At least MZ/NE/PE headers, probably LE/LX/P3 headers for old games?

Better detection:
- JPEG (see source code comments)
- GIF needs more testing (esp. with images generated by FractInt for example, as they use some undocumented extensions)
- MOD needs testing as well (I don't have *that* many different MOD file formats here)
- more IFF formats/subtypes?
- PDF needs more testing to make sure it's foolproof (esp. PDF-1.6)
- DDS needs some more testing, I think it's a bit broken, but I don't have adequat tools to check
- MP3 needs testing (VBR files at least. LayerI/II files, or MPEG2/2.5 files too, although those should be currently skipped)
